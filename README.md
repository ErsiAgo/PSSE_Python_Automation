# PSSE_python_automation
The aim of this document is to represent a full study of a Power Plant Project for Renewable Energy in the PSS/E environment software by automating every step with Python language. Main topics of this study will cover all the steps from creating the model from scratch in PSS/E and then performing all steady state and dynamic procedures finalized by observing results. Program Automation in PSS/E provides the mechanism to control PSS/E function executions other than by direct user interaction. This is also the ability to define a set of operations for PSS/E to perform in a file of some kind and to instruct the software to use the steps in that file as a single command. These files are called Automation files.
